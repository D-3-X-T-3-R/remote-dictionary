The RemoteDictionary class implements the three operations specified in the protocol: get, set, and stats. The handle_request method receives a JSON-formatted request, parses it, and calls the appropriate method based on the method field in the request.

The handle_get method looks up the specified key in the dictionary, updates the statistics, and returns a GetResponse in the form of a JSON-formatted string. The handle_set method stores the specified value in the dictionary at the specified key and returns a SetResponse. The handle_stats method returns a StatsResponse containing the dictionary statistics.

Each response is created using the create_response method, which takes a status and an optional data argument and returns a JSON-formatted string representing the response.

Note that the implementation assumes that the key and value parameters are both strings. If other data types need to be supported, the implementation can be modified to handle them accordingly.
